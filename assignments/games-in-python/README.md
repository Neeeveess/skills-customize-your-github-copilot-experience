## 🎯 Objective

Create a classic Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. You will practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and random selection to build an interactive word-guessing game.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Build the Hangman Game

#### Description
Build a complete Hangman game using Python. The game should randomly select a word from a predefined list and allow the player to guess letters one at a time. Display the current progress of the word with underscores for unguessed letters, track incorrect guesses, and end the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list of at least 5 words
- Accept single letter guesses from the player (validate input)
- Display current progress in format: `_ _ _ _ _` (underscores for hidden letters)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- Show all previously guessed letters
- End the game when the word is completely guessed (win) or attempts run out (lose)
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word revealed
